Introduction

Air pollution poses a serious threat to environmental and human health. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized indicator used to report daily air quality and communicate the level of health concern. This project aims to predict AQI levels using machine learning techniques based on various atmospheric pollutant concentrations such as CO, NO₂, O₃, and others. By analyzing real-world environmental data, this model helps in forecasting air quality, enabling better decision-making for public health and urban planning.

Features

Predicts AQI levels based on pollutant concentrations.
Uses real-world dataset from UCI Air Quality Dataset.
Built using Python and popular ML libraries.
Includes exploratory data analysis and visualization.
